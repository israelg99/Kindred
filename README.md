To adapt and win different environments, the agents ought to be versatile, the motto is *cut like a samurai and sting like a butterfly*.


**The best models in a given environment are in bold; models in italic can't solve the environment.*
### Cart Pole
- (**dq_dnn.py**) Double Q-learning with a Deep Q-Network using Boltzmann Q-Policy with a large Experience Replay.

### Frozen Lake
- (**dq_dnn.py**) Double Q-learning with a Deep Q-Network using Decaying Epsilon Q-Policy with a large Experience Replay.
- (*q_nn.py*) Q-learning with a neural network using Epsilon Q-Policy.
- (**q_table.py**) Q-learning with a table using Epsilon Q-Policy (other policies available in the code).

### Mountain Car
